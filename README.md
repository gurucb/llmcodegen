## LLM Query Engine
#### Leveraging LLM to generate queries for multiple databases and even APIs. Vision is to include both SQL (Traditional MYSQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) and NOSQL (Mongo,Cassandra, Gremlin, KQL). For generating prompts we will build and also leverage existing platforms like
* LLM Frameworks
    - Langchain:        https://docs.langchain.com/docs/ 
    - LLMA_Index:       https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index
    - Semantic Kernels: https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel 

And also leverage Chain of Thought from Google for prompt engineering.
